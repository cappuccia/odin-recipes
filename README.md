# odin-recipes

In this project I will practice what I have learned from the first lesson upto the HTML section of The Odin Project.

After finishing this project, I would have demonstrated the following skills:
    1. creating directories
    2. creating and initializing a new repository in GitHub
    3. cloning GitHub repository onto local directory
    4. using the README.md file
    5. creating html files
    6. filling-up the boilerplate of an html file
    7. properly using the git commands: git add, git commit
    8. creating directories and files inside directories
    9. properly using basic html elements
    10. html: inserting links
    11. html: adding images
    12. html: headings, paragraphs, unordered lists, ordered lists

It won't be pretty yet but it has the backbone!
